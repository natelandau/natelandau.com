1. [Hardcore History][1] - While technically a podcast, subscribing to this feed is actually like having an unabridged history audiobook delivered for free. Individual episodes can run to three or four hours and a complete topic could be nine or more hours of listening. If you're a history buff like me, this is a great feed.
2. [Blogs of War: Covert Contact][15] This podcast takes an interesting and in-depth look into many of the major national security issues of our time.
3. [Song Exploder][2] - This amazing show takes a look at a single song in each episode and breaks it down into its component parts. Drums, guitar, vocals, etc. Each of these elements is then explored in-depth by the composer in a fantastic interview.
4. [Startup][3] - Startup is a podcast that takes a narrative approach to telling the founding story of different companies. Each season they pick a different company to profile and tell the ups & downs, ins & outs of how the company got started.
5. [The History of Rome][4] - I found this podcast after it had been completed but I went back to the beginning and added all 180 episodes to my feed. Starting at the founding of the city of Rome around 470 B. C and following it's history through nearly a thousand years to 476 A.D when the last emperor was exiled from the city, listening to this podcast was akin to taking a great history course in college.
6. [Roderick on the Line][5] - This weekly podcast is simply a conversation between two fantastic storytellers and close friends. Their frank conversations move fluidly from music to popular culture, to personal reminiscences, to the minutiae of every day life.
7. [The Memory Palace][10] - Host Nate DiMeo curates amazing stories from collective past and tells them in engaging and well-produced five to ten minute episodes.
8. [Robot or Not][16] - This very funny and very short podcast (think about 3 min per episode) answers one question: is the object in question a robot. Daleks and Cybermen? Swimming Pool Cleaners? Pinocchio?
9. [Reply All][11] - This is a show about the curiosities of the Internet &mdash; stories about how the Internet shapes people; and how people shape the Internet.
10. [99% Invisible][9] - Nominally about architecture and design, this lovingly produced show tells the stories and histories about objects, buildings, structures, and ideas that have shaped our modern world.
