summary: A simple process for checking references of prospective employees.
---

Here are my learnings from the hundreds of reference checks I've performed over the years and information gleaned from recruiters and colleagues. I've gelled them into **a process with eight questions** that _usually_ succeed in getting a reference to tell me useful and actionable information during a phone call.

## Why checking references is critical

In the small startups I have spent my career building there are few decisions as critical as hiring the right people. Bringing in the wrong employee can saddle you with years of sub-par performance and may mean the difference between closing your next VC round and having your company disappear into obscurity.

Someone once told me that **the process of hiring someone is an exercise in finding reasons to say "no".** I couldn't agree more. No one will fault you for a difficult hiring process. Your current employees will appreciate not being saddled with under performing co-workers. Your job candidates will gain a sense of confidence in your company's ability to succeed.

My interviews are hard and my process is lengthy. Once a candidate has impressed me sufficiently in their interviews to potentially warrant an offer, I have one final chance to deny them a job...the reference check.

## Ask the Easy Questions

Every question asked in a reference check should be open ended. Instead of saying _"Can you confirm that Joe was a Senior Product Manager?"_. Ask the reference to tell you Joe's title.

I find it unlikely that your candidate would have lied to you. But it's always best to confirm everything independently when possible.

**Question 1: Would you please confirm his/her dates of employment?**

**Question 2: Would you please confirm his/her job title?**

## Give a Chance for Praise

References are pre-selected by candidates to give good reviews of their work. This part of the phone call asks questions designed to let them do just that.

**Question 3: Please comment on the accuracy of the following job description.** (Now, read the job description your candidate wrote on their resume.)

**Question 4: I was told about Project X, can you confirm his/her involvement? And can you tell me about the results?** (Pick the project that the candidate told you about in the interview process that you think will be the most revealing.)

**Question 5: What was his/her best contribution?**

## Dig for actionable information

Now, finally, we're at the point where we hope to learn something real about our potential hire.

**Question 6: What would you say his/her areas for improvement are?**

**Question 7: We are thinking about hiring him/her for XXXXX position. How would your rate that fit?**

**Question 8: If you were me, would you have any concerns about hiring him/her?**

That's it. You can now go to sleep knowing that you have done everything you can to hire an effective team member.
