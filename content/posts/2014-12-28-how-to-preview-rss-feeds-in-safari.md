Safari in Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite is a great browser. I've switched from Google Chrome and now use Safari as my browser of choice for every day web usage. That said, Safari is terrible when it comes to handling RSS feeds. There simply is no way to change Safari's RSS preferences without adding a 3rd party extension.

I remain an RSS loyalist and read (or at least parse) hundreds of feeds on a daily basis. My RSS service of choice is the amazing (and constantly improving) [feedbin.com](https://feedbin.com/). Feedbin is a web service and not a native Mac application. To add a link to an RSS feed you need to copy it from your browser. Not an easy task with Yosemite's Safari.

I tested many extensions for Safari before finding the one that solved the problem: [RSS Button for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rss-button-for-safari/id1437501942). What does it do?

-   **Adds a button to the Safari toolbar** listing feeds on the page you are viewing.
-   **Automatically select the URL** of the feed for easy copy/pasting.
-   Allows you to **preview the feed** before subscribing.

You can [install it here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rss-button-for-safari/id1437501942).
